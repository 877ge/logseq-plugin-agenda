# Events

Events fall into two categories:
- journal: tasks in the journal
- project: tasks in other notes

## Journal

Use the date of the diary as the date of the task, and when the task starts with a time, treat it as the specific time of the task.

Example:
![journal tasks](../../screenshots/journal-tasks.png)


## Project

The following methods are supported to set the task date:

- date reference: `task [[Jun 10th, 2022]]`
- scheduled
- deadline
- agenda link: (Right mouse button block dot, select "Modify Schedule")
- start and end property

Example:
